# LetsHelpEachOther

Hi Friends !!
Saw most of them posting about accommodation for the needful people affected by rain using Facebook. 
#chennairains 
I really appreciate this !! #HelpOthers 
And so here is my contribution to the people who needs help and those lovely hearts who made the social network a useful one. 
#ChennaiRainHelp
Here's a Rain Relief Portal where you can update your details for sharing your information. Choose whether you want to share accommodation, Food or Parking for Vehicles. The same can be used by people who seek for such facilities in your area. This would be effective only if you share this to everyone.

This is a portal that was developed to help each other during the 2015 Chennai Rain. This got a huge support and appreciation from different organisations and people.
